/**
 A quantity sample type that measures the amount of time the user spent exercising.
 
 This quantity type measures every full minute of movement that equals or exceeds the intensity of a brisk walk.
 
 Apple watch automatically records exercise time.
 By default, the watch uses the accelerometer to estimate the intensity of the userâ€™s movement.
 However, during workout sessions, the watch uses additional sensors, like the heart rate sensor and GPS, to generate estimates.
 
 ``HKWorkoutSession`` sessions also contribute to the exercise time.
 For more information, see [Fill the Activity rings](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/healthkit/hkworkout#2961963).
 These samples use time units (described in ``HKUnit``) and measure cumulative values (described in ``HKQuantityAggregationStyle``).

 The default unit is seconds.
