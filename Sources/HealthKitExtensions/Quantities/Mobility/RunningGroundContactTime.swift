/**
 A quantity sample type that measures the amount of time the runnerâ€™s foot is in contact with the ground while running.

 These samples use time units (described in ``HKUnit``) and measure discrete values (described in ``HKQuantityAggregationStyle``).
 During outdoor running workouts, the system automatically records ground contact time on Apple Watch SE and Series 6 and later.

 The default unit is seconds.
